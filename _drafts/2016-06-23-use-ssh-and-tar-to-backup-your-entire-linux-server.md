### Use SSH and tar to Backup Your Entire Linux Server

Sometimes I just need to make a backup of every single thing that could ever possibly be important on my server\. Rather than selectively backup only the things I need, I made this script that will just backup the whole damn thing\! It even pipes the whole backup to another server\. ðŸ‘¾
```
tar -zcf - --directory / --exclude=mnt --exclude=proc --exclude=tmp --exclude=run --exclude var/spool . | ssh -i YOUR_RSA_KEY_PATH backups@my.backup-server.com "cat > /backup_disk/vps/full-backup-`date '+%d-%B-%Y'`.tar.gz"
```

All of the data is piped into `tar` , `gzip` , then `ssh` \. The data is never permanently saved to the server that is running the script\.
#### Donâ€™t Forget:
- Replace `YOUR_RSA_KEY_PATH` with your own RSA key path, or just use a password\. I always use RSA keys on all of my servers for extended security, and disable password authentication\.
- Replace the `ssh` username and address\.
- Exclude any directories that should not be backed up\.


Let me know if you need any help\!
