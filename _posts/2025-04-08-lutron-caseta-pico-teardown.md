I've been messing with Lutron CasÃ©ta smart switches around my home recently. I wanted to see what was inside one of my Pico remotes (model number `PJ2-P2B`), so I took it apart.

Inside is a CR2032 coin cell which supposedly lasts up to 10 years, and people on the web agree.

All the components live on the back of the motherboard, except two metal dome switches for the on/off buttons.

There's also a loop antenna near the bottom of the backside of the board, though it is difficult to make it out.

The main chip is an Si4010-C2 from Silicon Labs. This is a low-power sub-GHz RF transmitter. [Datasheet.](/assets/docs/Si4010.pdf)

From the diagrams, it is clear to me that this chip is very purpose-built for an application like a simple remote control. It's a simple enough circuit that you could easily build your own with a protoboard and a few components. The chip can be purchased [on DigiKey](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/silicon-labs/SI4010-C2-GS/2441251) in small quantities for about 4-5 bucks each.

Of course if you wanted to make it work with the Lutron system, you'd have to reverse engineer their protocol. I wouldn't be surprised if that info is already on the web.

Anyway, that's a look inside the remote. I'm putting it back together now ðŸ™‚ It's going on the wall of my stairwell.
