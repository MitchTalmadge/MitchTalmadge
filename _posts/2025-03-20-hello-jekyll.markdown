This is my first time using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I once [created my own blog in Angular](https://github.com/MitchTalmadge/Old-Portfolio), but it became neglected due to its high maintenance costs and my lack of free time with my full-time job and other life obligations. 

So... today, I am combining [GitHub Pages and Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll), an apparently very popular combination:

![Search results on GitHub.com for "jekyll" returns 80 thousand results](/assets/images/2025-03-20-jekyll-search-results.png)

...and it's already obvious why it's so loved. In the very little time I've spent playing with this, I have already decided that I won't be going back to Angular or React for a web portfolio. This is just SO much easier to manage. I think my favorite part is that I can write just about everything in markdown, and don't need to worry about the HTML/CSS/JS; in other words, I can just focus on the content.
