This is my first time using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I once [created my own blog in Angular](https://github.com/MitchTalmadge/Old-Portfolio), but it became neglected due to its high maintenance costs (e.g. keeping packages up-to-date) and my lack of free time with my full-time job and other life obligations. 

So... today, I am combining GitHub Pages and Jekyll, an apparently very popular combination. It's already obvious why. This is much easier to maintain :)
