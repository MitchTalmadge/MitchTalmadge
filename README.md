<h1 align="center">Aloha! ðŸŒº My name is Mitch.</h1>

I'm a Facebook Production Engineer intern, full-time Computer Science Master's student, and aspiring NASA Astronaut.

I have a passion for the Hawaiian culture, and I care deeply about preserving its beautiful language. In my free time I love to weld, fix cars, build electronics, and so much more.
