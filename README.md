<h1 align="center">Aloha! ðŸŒº My name is Mitch.</h1>

ðŸ’» I'm a Facebook Production Engineer intern, full-time Computer Science post-graduate student, and aspiring NASA Astronaut. ðŸš€

ðŸ¤™ I have a passion for the Hawaiian culture, and I care deeply about preserving its beautiful language.

ðŸ›  In my free time I love to weld, fix cars, build electronics, go on hikes, and camp in the forest.

â™¥ My favorite languages are TypeScript, Golang, and Python, but I have extensive experience creating applications in a large number of languages with many of the most popular tools, libraries, and frameworks -- including AWS, GCP, Docker, React, Angular, Webpack, Spring, Node.JS, Zend, and SO much more. I am never afraid to learn new technology, as my 10+ years of experience in Computer Science allows me to spot the inherent similarities between old and new tools and languages to make for a very quick ramp-up into any project.
