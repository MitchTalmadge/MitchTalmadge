<h1 align="center">Aloha! 🌺 My name is Mitch.</h1>

💻 I'm a senior software engineer at <a href="https://conexed.com/">ConexED</a>, full-time Computer Science post-graduate student, and aspiring NASA Astronaut. 🚀

🤙 I have a passion for the Hawaiian culture, and I care deeply about preserving its beautiful language.

🛠 In my free time I love to weld, fix cars, build electronics, go on hikes, and camp in the forest.

♥ My favorite languages are TypeScript, Golang, and Python, but I have extensive experience creating applications in a large number of languages with many of the most popular tools, libraries, and frameworks -- including AWS, GCP, Docker, React, Angular, Webpack, Spring, Node.JS, Zend, and SO much more. I am never afraid to learn new technology, as my 10+ years of experience in Computer Science allows me to spot the inherent similarities between old and new tools and languages to make for a very quick ramp-up into any project.

👨‍💻 My software engineering experience covers everything from the web browser to embedded circuitry. I have created full-scale web applications in Angular and React, I have helped companies achieve their goals in load balancing and auto-scaling with AWS, and I have constructed entire IoT ecosystems from start to finish. This included everything from the C++ embedded firmware and WiFi management libraries, the Angular-based mobile setup app, the RESTful API between IoT devices and the Java Spring backend, and the Angular-based web management dashboard. In this project, I had even used my knowledge of electronics to help the electrical engineers resolve problems in their circuitry. 

There is no project so big that I cannot help; I am extremely passionate about what I do, and I am ready to dive in and find eloquent solutions to any problem.
