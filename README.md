<h1 align="center">Aloha! ðŸŒº My name is Mitch.</h1>

ðŸ’» I'm a Facebook Production Engineer intern, full-time Computer Science post-graduate student, and aspiring NASA Astronaut. ðŸš€

ðŸ¤™ I have a passion for the Hawaiian culture, and I care deeply about preserving its beautiful language. ðŸŒº

ðŸ›  In my free time I love to weld, fix cars, build electronics, go on hikes, and camp in the forest. ðŸŒ²

â™¥ My favorite languages are TypeScript, Golang, and Python, but I have extensive experience creating applications in a large number of languages with many of the most popular tools, libraries, and frameworks -- including AWS, GCP, Docker, React, Angular, Webpack, Spring, Node.JS, Zend, and SO much more. I am never afraid to learn new technology, as my 10+ years of experience in Computer Science allows me to spot the inherent similarities between old and new tools and languages to make for a very quick ramp-up into any project.

I'm highly motivated and quickly make effective contributions with any combination of language and design philosophy that a product requires. I love to help others bring their dreams to reality through careful design choices and capacity planning, which ensures that their product will have great uptime and reliability for years to come.

And finally, I love to help my community. Open source software is the backbone of almost every application created in our modern age. I try to do my part to contribute to this cause wherever possible.
