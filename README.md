<h1 align="center">Aloha! 🌺 My name is Mitch.</h1>

💻 I'm a senior software engineer at <a href="https://conexed.com/">ConexED</a>.

🎓 In 2021 I received my Master of Science in Computer Science degree from the University of Utah

🤙 I have a passion for the Hawaiian culture, and I care deeply about preserving its beautiful language.

🛠 In my free time I love to weld, fix cars, build electronics, go on hikes, and camp in the forest.

♥ My favorite languages are TypeScript, Golang, and Python, but I have extensive experience creating applications in a large number of languages with many of the most popular tools, libraries, and frameworks -- including AWS, GCP, Docker, React, Angular, Webpack, Spring, Node.JS, Zend, Laravel, and SO much more. I am never afraid to learn new technology, as my 12+ years of experience in Computer Science allow me to spot the inherent similarities between old and new tools and languages to make for a very quick ramp-up into any project.

👨‍💻 My software engineering experience covers everything from the web browser to embedded circuitry. I have created full-scale web applications in Angular, React, and Vue; I have helped companies achieve their goals in load balancing and auto-scaling with AWS; and I have constructed entire IoT ecosystems from start to finish -- including everything from the C++ embedded firmware, WiFi management libraries, Angular-based mobile setup app, RESTful API, Java Spring backend, and Angular-based device dashboard. For that project, I even used my knowledge in electrical engineering to help resolve problems in the IoT circuitry. 

There is no project so big that I cannot help; I am extremely passionate about what I do, and I am ready to dive in and find eloquent solutions to any problem.
